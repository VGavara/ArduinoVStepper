# Overview
C++ library containing controllers for different stepper motors. The library does not use any motor driver for interacting with the stepper motors, thus it becomes virtual and therefore open to any kind of stepper motor by using the suitable driver.

This C++ library contains a set of classes for controlling different stepper motors:
- _Add a list item per library class with a brief explanation of its features_

# At a glance
_Insert here short yet clarifying examples of each library class to get a quick idea of its features_

# Getting started
First, download the library source files from the [latest release available](https://github.com/VGavara/ArduinoVStepper/releases/latest) and install them locally by following the tutorial [Installing Additional Arduino Libraries](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries), specifically as explained in the sections "Importing a .zip library" or "Manual installation".

Once installed locally, you can download and test any of the examples contained in the [examples](https://github.com/VGavara/ArduinoVStepper/tree/stable/examples) directory.

Finally, you can get detailed information of every class by reading the references contained in the directory [docs/classes](https://github.com/VGavara/ArduinoVStepper/tree/stable/docs/classes).

# Repository structure
This repository is structured in these directories:
- [/docs](https://github.com/VGavara/ArduinoVStepper/tree/stable/docs): It contains the library documentation, as classes references and datasheets.
- [/examples](https://github.com/VGavara/ArduinoVStepper/tree/stable/examples): It contains usage examples of each class. It is a good place for getting a quick idea regarding what this library can do for you.
- [/src](https://github.com/VGavara/ArduinoVStepper/tree/stable/src): It contains the library source code.
